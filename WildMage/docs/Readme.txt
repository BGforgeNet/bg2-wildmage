1.       INTRODUCTION

Chaotic Magic is fun, I always liked worlds like Moorcock's where magic
is something incredible powerful and dangerous for opponents, friends
and the caster alike.

Wild Magic brings some of that fun into the D&D universe, 
where magic usually is a reliable science with strict rules and rituals.

Throne of Bhaal introduced the wild mage, but didn't feature much wild magic.
When playing a wild mage in TOB you end up casting Nahal's Reckless Dweomer
time and again, and more often than not, you save/reload, until it works out 
as you intended (Well, at least I did...)

The sorcerer on the other hand is neat and has the much-desired ability to
cast spells on demand, but lacks the wizard's flexibility in learning new spells.
Playing a Sorcerer is fun in Pen & Paper D&D, but not in Baldur's Gate:


In P&P RPG, a Wizard needs expensive and bulky spellbooks that may only contain
a limited number of spells. Most of the spells a P&P Wizard "knows" are savely at
home in several Spellbooks neatly arranged in a shelf. There is no way to memorize
one of those spells unless the wizard returns home to fetch the spellbook...
So in P&P, a Wizard who is "on the road" has access to maybe 50% more spells than
the Sorcerer, but the Wizard's spellcasting abilities can be crippled by destroying
or stealing his spellbook, while the Sorcerer always has access to his spells...

In Baldur's Gate, a wizard always has access to every spell he "knows", while the
Sorcerer is still bound to his P&P restrictions. When a game features 204 spells 
to which one kind of mage has full access but must memorize them, there isn't much
point in playing another kind of mage that may cast spells on demand but can learn
only 45 of those 204 spells, without a way to exchange a spell when learning it
turned out to be a mistake...


Sovran's "Art of Weaving" mod inspired me to create another kind of Wizard:
The "Spellshaper" can cast spells spontaneously like a sorcerer, but instead of
being restricted in the number of known spell, he suffers strong restrictions in
the number of spells that can be cast per day as well as the speed in which he
gains access to new spell levels.

While testing this kit, I realized that the game still misses wild magic spells.
First I made a few spells, a spellshaper learned automatically, but then the spells
grew more and more. So I decided to make 2 spells for each spell-level and give
all wild mages the opportunity to learn them.


************************************************************************** 

2.       COMPONENTS


2.1      WILD MAGIC SPELLS
         
         This component features 27 new wild magic spells and an unique cast-once spell.
         See "SPELLS.PDF" for detailed spell descriptions.

         After installation, rest outdoors. You can also rest in an inn and leave
         the inn right thereafter. You will meet a wild mage and gain access to his
         spellbook, from which you will be able to learn one spell per level of 
         experience. If there are no wild mages in your party then the mod ends at
         this point. You can sell the spellbook - only wild mages can use it.



2.2      SPELLSHAPER

         A Spellshaper can't rely as much on his magic as a wizard - his spellcasting
         abilities are comparable to those of a bard, and his spellweaving ability might
         backfire. He has a wide selection of spells (some of them not even accessible
         to a wizard or standard wild mage) but can't cast them very often. In exchange
         the Spellshaper has combat abilities comparable to a rogue, and more often than
         not solves "problems" by mundane means, saving his magic as a last-resort tool.

	 All in all, the spellshaper is a heedless opportunist, to whom magic is a 
         powerful but unreliable tool - no more and no less valuable than a good 
         melee weapon. Imagine Elric fighting with two daggers instead of a great sword
         and you know the base concept of the Spellshaper class. 
         
         See "SPELLSHAPER.PDF" for more details.

         
         There are two ways to become a Spellshaper:
 
         1. When the protagonist is a non-lawful Wild Mage, he'll have the chance
            to become a Spellshaper in the midst of combat, when he gets badly hurt.

         2. Lawful protagonists and other party members need to study Rhialto's spellbook   
            One of the spells - "Rhialto's Chaos Conduit" forces the same changes
            upon the caster, that happen spontaneously to a non-lawful protagonist.



2.3	 SPELLSHAPER - AVATAR CHANGE

         The Spellshaper is meant to be a kind of "rogueish" mage (or a "magey" rogue)
         as opposed to the standard "robe & pointy hat" fantasy wizard. The mage-avatar
         isn't fitting for this character (at least not for the Spellshaper I'm playing)

         This component changes the character's avatar when he becomes a Spellshaper:

         Female Spellshapers use the Thief avatar
         Male Spellshapers use the Cleric avatar 




2.4	 MISC SPELL MODIFICATIONS

         This component is independent of the other components, and modifies some of
         the original spells:
 
         "Magic Missiles" 
           The missiles now always do 1d4+1 points of damage, as they're supposed to.
           Originally it was 2d2 at level 3-8 and 2d2+1 at levels 1,2 and 9+

         "Dimension Door" 
           Like dozens of other wizards in the game, you now can target any nearby place
           you've already visited. There no longer needs to be a clear path within the 
           caster's viewing distance that leads to the destination-area. You can select
           any place within the area where you've been already. (This component doesn't 
           include scrolls to learn the spell, if you don't play a spellshaper you need
           another mod, or use Shadowkeeper to learn the spell or get the scroll)




2.5	 STATIONARY BG1-RHIALTO (HAUGHTY PANSY MODE) - (BG1-tutu and BGT only)

	 Some people seem to have a problem with a lone level 1 mage having to run 
         away from a vastly overpowered opponent. Still, the same people love to rest
         in the wilderness right after Gorion's dead.

         If you're one of them, install this component, it will prevent Rhialto from
         showing up after resting outside in BG1-Tutu and the BG1-Part of BGT.
         Instead, Rhialto waits for you on a fixed position outside Candlekeep's walls,
         you can face him on your own terms.

         Just remember: Rhialto was never meant to be killed by an equal opponent. 
         The whole mod and especially the confrontation was made for a 1st level Mage 
         who just left Candlekeep, and you miss out the fun of the lower level Wild Mage
         spells when you confront him just before you go after Sarevok.  


**************************************************************************

3.       COMPATIBILITY

 This mod requires Throne of Bhaal.
 It is designed to run with BG2 SOA/TOB as well as BG1TUTU
 (See "COMPATIBILITY.PDF" for detailed info) 

 The mod works fine with multiplayer games. Several wild mages in a 
 multiplayer game are also supported.

 A character that uses Sorvan's "Spellweaver" kit may learn the new wild magic spells,
 but when he changes to my Spellshaper Class, Sorvan's script will be overwritten,
 and the character will stop to gain new abilities from Sorvan's kit.

 Dual- and Multiclass wild mages may become Spellshapers, though there
 are cosmetic problems (Both classes named "Spellshaper" in records-sheet).
 Also, some combinations might be a bit overpowered and cheesy. (see below)

 The Spellshaper "Kit" works fine with mods that change the wizard's spell progression
 to the correct Pen&Paper values. Nonetheless, a Spellshaper's spell-slot penalty
 is designed for the BG2-tables where a loss of 2 spell slots equals 33% of the 
 maximum available. If you play with core-rules spell progression, high-level 
 Spellshapers will be a lot more powerful than intended.

**************************************************************************

4.       KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES / BUGS

 - Other mods that change the override script are incompatible with the 
   spellshaper's character script.
 
 - "Weave Spell" acts a bit strange with wizard spells from other mods:
   As long as you still have original Bioware-spells or spells from this mod
   memorized, using "Weave Spell" will drain the modded spells from memory
   just like the others, but when there are only modded spells memorized,
   you can't use the "Weave Spell" ability. 

 - Multiclass Spellshapers get their Spellshaper abilities from the highest
   level. A "Wild Mage/Thief" may become a Spellshaper but will be quite cheesy.
   (Well, a multiclass Wild Mage is cheated anyway...)

 - Spellshapers that dual-classed from wild mage to another class will 
   continue to gain Spellshaper abilities when they advance in the new class.
   (Thus, a mod that allows wild mages to dual class might be considered a "cheat")

 - Items that raise the number of Spell-Slots, when worn by a Spellshaper,
   might cause him to forget all spells of tbe modified level upon resting.
   This seems to be an engine-glitch, and I have no idea how to fix it.
   The solution is simply NOT to wear such items (they definitely don't work
   for a Spellshaper)
   
 - When a Spellshaper is level-drained, he may get bonus-spell-slots, 
   when the game resets his number of spells. Once he is restored to the old
   level, the number of spells is also restored. The only way to "fix" this
   seems to grant the Spellshaper permanent immunity to level-drain...



 NO BUGS:

 - Right after a Spellshaper advanced to 20th level, he is stunned for a second.
   This happens on purpose, to prevent you from equipping a Ring of Wizardry
   while the "Hand"-item (which normally prevents you from using Metamagic items)
   is exchanged in order to actualize the char's number of memorizable spells.
 
 - "Hornung's Random Dispatcher" is a level 7 spell on purpose. You can't 
   use it for planar-traveling in Baldur's Gate, so basically it's just
   a fancy "Disintegrate" - no reason to make it a Level 8 spell.

 - Some of the other spells also weren't realized completely true 
   to their original descriptions. This was either "artistic freedom" 
   or neccessary due to engine restrictions and/or balancing reasons. 

 - "Summon Cow" occasionally damages every creature in the whole area.
   this seems to be hard-coded and intended by Bioware. It also happens
   with the wild surge and the original 2nd level "Easter Egg"-spell.

-  Rhialto is a hard opponent for a level 1 mage and is supposed to be.
   This mod was made for BG1Tutu, not BG2. Rhialto is much too easy in a BG2
   game with full party. So delaying 




**************************************************************************

5.       HINTS/MISC

 - Agreed, Rhialto is a very powerful foe. Nonetheless you can beat him 
   with a lone 1st level mage that has only 4 hitpoints. I've done it
   dozens of times while testing this mod.

   The secret is to flee and hope that he might have an accident while 
   chasing you. In fact, it's harder to fight him with a full party,
   because he really enjoys watching what Glyph of Wild Magic does to
   your little army...

   
 - If you really need to rest and want to delay Rhialto's appearance,
   pause the game while resting, and after resting Quicksave and Reload
   without unpausing the game.

05.Oct.2005 (v0.9)

 - Ready for testing...



28.Oct.2005 (v1.0)

 + "Spellweaver" renamed to "Spellshaper" to avoid mistakening him with
   Sovran's Spellweaver Kit (a "Wild Sorcerer") or the D&D3 prestige class 
   (a scientific Spellcaster with an almost religious dedication)

 + Spellshaper is no longer called "Wild Mage" in Records Screen

 + Rhialto no longer appears in Candlekeep or Irenicus' Dungeon

 + Spellshaper's spell-advancement changed:
   1st-level spells at experience-level 1-5 are now 1,2,2,3,3 instead of 0,1,1,2,3

 + "Weave Spell" no longer provides extra spells that can be cast in addition
   to conventional spells. The ability now drains memorized wizard spells, 
   and may be used as long as there are still spells memorized.

 + Optimized Spellshaper's THAC0 and Feat progress to favor lower levels
   THAC0 progress is now almost identical to rogue, more feats at lower levels.

 + Spellshaper now gains "Weaveshear" every 9 levels instead of Level 10,25,45

 + Implemented spontaneous Class-Change to Spellshaper for non-lawful Wild Mage

 - Skull Bomb may no longer be used by Wizard Slayer

 - When Rhialto casts Glyph of Wild Magic, and injures/kills 
   innoccent bystanders, they no longer blame the party. 

 - Spellshaper didn't get the 66% lore bonus - fixed

 - Removed the permanent Swirling Lights effect caused by Weave Spell (what the...)

 - A Spellshaper can no longer equip a ring of wizardry while advancing to 20th 
   and 45th level to have his number of spell-slots raised.



30.Oct.2005 (v1.1)

 - Spellshaper: -1 saving throw penalty was removed at next levelup - fixed

 - Spellshaper: -2 missile damage penalty actually was a +253 Bonus - fixed

 - Spellshaper: Fixed a bug, where a Spellshaper could get infinite feats
                by having party members talking to him...

 - Spellshaper: Cosmetics: Wild Magic Backlash displayed random Text instead of "Wild Magic"

 - Spellshaper: Cosmetics: Text comments for Random Wild Surges after resting were missing



23.Nov.2005 (v1.2)

 + Fixed spellbook-dialogue bug when learning Rhialto's Chaos Conduit instead
   of becoming a Spellweaver spontaneously

 + Added optional avatar-change for Spellshaper.


 + Spellshaper: Cosmetics: Added advantages and disadvantages to in-game Kit-description

 
 + Spellshaper: Fixed a bug, where sometimes the feat-gaining dialogue interrupted the
                Levelup process (No damage was done just weird behavior)


 + Spellshaper: "Shape Spell" is no longer a Feat but learned automatically at 5th level.

    
 + Spellshaper: Modified "Weave Spell" functionality:

    1. Number of uses per day is now limited depending on level (once per day per 2/3 levels)   
       (Additional uses per day may be chosen as a feat)

    2. Weave Spell is now (again) in the "Cast Spell" Menu and may be selected as Quick Spell

    3. It's now possible to switch to other spell-levels in the spell selection-menu.
       Going to spell levels that require an additional spell to be removed from memory 
       will drain the highest memorized spell, going back from a higher spell level to one
       that requires less spells to be drained will only restore a 1st level spell, though.


 + Spellshaper: Modified "Weave Spell" Spell-Selection:

    * Removed "Find Familiar" (pointless to have a cast-once spell here)
    * Moved "Protection from Petrification" from 1st to 2nd Level (Bugfix)
    * Moved "Earthquake" from 8th to 9th level (may still be cast at experience-level 22)
    * Added 1st level spell "Find Traps" (Like priest spell, but duration only one turn)
    * Added 1st level spell "Intoxication" (Victim must save vs. death or become intoxicated)

08.Jan.2006 (v1.3)

 - Fix: Spellshaper: Class wasn't displayed on top of Character sheet

 - Fix: "Rodent Form" and it's twin now prevent the caster from casting them several times.
        (thus it's no longer possible to gain cummulative effects...)

 - Tweak: Tuned down "Vortex". Now it does only 2d6 points of electricity, magic and shock 
          damage (safe for half). Most enemies now ignore the Vortex (it's "invisible")

 - Tweak: "Cellular Regeneration" now allows a saving throw vs. death when cast on enemies
          (Can no longer be abused as a guaranted way to knock out enemies...)

 

17.Feb.2006 (v1.4)

 + More compatibility: Installation of Spellshaper "Kit" no longer modifies "LUMA0.2DA"

 + Added optional component "Misc Spell Modifications"  that fixes glitches with original spells.
   (As yet: Dimension Door no longer needs LOS + Magic Missile now does 1d4+1 damage)

 + Added 8 new wild magic spells and made "Entropy Burst" a real wild magic spell.

 - Tweak: Cosmetics: "Teleport Portal" and "Dimension Door" graphically improved

 - Tweak: reduced casting time of "Wildstrike" from 6 to 3 for balancing reasons.
 
 - Tweak: reduced casting time of "Wild Sphere" from 12 to 6 for balancing reasons.


 + Spellshaper changes:

    * Spellshaper doesn't get any high level abilities (including level 10 spells)

    * Changed Level 30+ feat progress to 1/3 levels, and required max int. to 19

    * Removed the -1 Saving Throw penalty 
      (too confusing in records screen and not that much of a disadvantage)

    * May no longer spend 3 points in Dagger profiency, maximum is now 2.

    * Made appearance of random items as "wild dream" effect 3 times more likely

    * "Shape Spell": Fix: Ability can no longer fail due to magic resistance
                     Spellshaper gains this Ability now at 10th level.
                     Changed Shape Spell progression to max out at 35th level. 

    * "Weave Spell": Ability now also works when only spells from this mod are memorized
                     Ability can now create 10th level spells.

                only with x4 Backstab-Multiplier not with x5 or higher.

 + Fixed an inconsistency with Rhialto's Spellbook: When not learned at level 17 or 18,
   Wildfire would vanish from the book 'till you reached 20th level.

 + Fixed a problem with a Spellshaper and the spell Rhialto's Marvelous Reincarnation.



27.Mar.2008 (v1.6)

 + Added russian translation (Thanks to Toha K.)

 - Fix: Spellshaper: Class-name wasn't displayed on top of Character sheet
                     (Fix from v1.4a didn't make it into v1.5...)


11.Jun.2009 (v1.7)

 + Added french translation (Thanks to Darien and Graoumf)

"Rhialto's Chaos Conduit establishes a link between the caster and the chaotic plane of Limbo, and then channels raw chaotic energy right into the caster. The purpose of this process is to open the caster's mind for a different kind of spellcasting.\n"
"\n"
"Although the spell's invocation is easy enough to make it available as a 1st level spell, its inner structure is incredible complex and would be appropriate for a spell of 9th, 10th or even higher level. The spell's chaotic nature might partly be responsible for this strange discrepancy.\n"

"The spell can be cast only once and its effect is irrevocable. The caster's spellcasting capabilities are permanently changed towards a more intuitive way, and the same happens to his personality.\n"

"These changes don't come from the spell itself, though. Rhialto's Chaos Conduit only frees and amplifies tendencies and interests that are already there. Persons that aren't interested in the gifts this spell has to offer, would be immune against its effects. However, such persons wouldn't even think of casting a spell like this in the first place.\n"

"Other than its name suggests, this spell has nothing to do with making the caster more attractive. When Mynoc's Irresistible Appeal is cast, a rope consisting of raw magical energy appears; this rope loops itself around the targeted creature and then shortens, drawing the target toward the caster.\n"
"\n"
"There is no saving throw against this spell and it bypasses all magic resistances the targeted creature might have. While this spell is mainly used to get friends out of trouble (or learn to know new ones), some wild mages are known to be crazy enough to cast this spell on enemies to force them into melee-combat."

"This spell was created by the gnomish wild mage Meece Upknot as a means of combat protection. Meece couldn't decide whether stoutness or hiding is the best way to survive a fight, so he made a spell that combines both.\n"
"\n"
"The caster of the Wildarmor spell is protected by intense fluctuations in the magical weave around him. This distortion bends the laws of probability to a point where it serves as protection against all forms of damage. For the duration of the spell there is a high probability that any direct attack done to the caster has as smaller effect than it should have; thus all damage intended for the caster is reduced by 20%. However, there is also a 50% chance that the attack distorts the magic field surrounding the caster, causing a wild surge.\n"
"\n"
"After the damage done by an attack was reduced, the spell renders the caster invisible to avert further damage. This invisibility lasts for 5 rounds, until dispelled, or until the caster attacks any creature.\n"
"\n"
"The spell's duration is 5 rounds for every level of the caster, up to 2 hours at 20th level."

"As a Spellshaper you have the ability to release the raw magical energy of memorized spells and \"weave\" it into a new spell effect. The shape the magical power can take is only limited by your imagination. Wearing a ring on this hand would not only hinder your handicraft, it would also disrupt the flow of magic, effectively crippling your spellweaving ability.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"SPELLSHAPER:\n"
"\n"
"The spellshaper is a practitioner of wild magic who casts his spells by virtue of raw magical talent or gift, as opposed to a wild mage's academic, systematic approach.\n"
"\n"
"Spellshapers share the sorcerer's intuitive understanding for arcane magic. They memorize spells like a wizard, yet have a second resource at their disposal: A Spellshaper has the ability to \"weave\" raw magic energy into spell effects of his desire, without need of preparing those spells ahead of time. This talent is anything but unfailing, and using it on a regular basis requires as much luck as recklessness. Persons who use such a talent aren't very popular among conservative spellcasters.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike the sorcerer, the spellshaper may learn spells from scrolls, and memorize and cast them like a wizard. Being opportunists at heart, rarely a spellshaper renounces this relative reliable way of working magic. It's usually reserved for those protective and last-resort spells that really need to work, though. The spellshaper's talent to cast spells spontaneously is so convenient that he prefers to use it whenever possible.\n"
"\n"
"Neglecting conventional spellcasting, and focussing on chaotic wild magic doesn't come without a price: A spellshaper can't memorize as many spells as a true mage, and his progress in getting access to new spell levels is much slower.\n"
"\n"
"Persons of this profession also tend to be a bit eccentric: Their undisciplined nature was what led them to their alternative way of spellcasting in the first place, and constant contact with chaotic wild magic affects the spellshaper's personality even more. Similar to a bard, a spellshaper has a lot of interests: He intuitively learns a bit of everything that crosses his path, but lacks the discipline to master these things to the same extend as a more focused character.\n"
"\n"
"Most spellshapers have the wisdom not to rely exclusively on their dangerous and unpredictable spell ability. They hedge their bets by learning physical combat as well. They aren't warriors, but a spellshaper's abilities in melee combat are close to those of a thief. As he gets more experienced, the spellshaper may learn special abilities that improve his combat techniques even more, these abilities include backstabbing, mastery in the dagger proficiency and the unique ability to fight with two weapons at once without facing any penalties.\n"
"\n"
"One of the spellshaper's more eccentric character-traits is that he refuses any training in the use of missile weapons; for ranged combat, a spellshaper uses magic, and if magic fails he prefers melee.\n"

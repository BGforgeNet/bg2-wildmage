"As a Spellshaper you have the ability to release the raw magical energy of memorized spells and \"weave\" it into a new spell effect. The shape the magical power can take is only limited by your imagination. Wearing a ring on this hand would not only hinder your handicraft, it would also disrupt the flow of magic, effectively crippling your spellweaving ability.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"SPELLSHAPER:\n"
"\n"
"The spellshaper is a practitioner of wild magic who casts his spells by virtue of raw magical talent or gift, as opposed to a wild mage's academic, systematic approach.\n"
"\n"
"Spellshapers share the sorcerer's intuitive understanding for arcane magic. They memorize spells like a wizard, yet have a second resource at their disposal: A Spellshaper has the ability to \"weave\" raw magic energy into spell effects of his desire, without need of preparing those spells ahead of time. This talent is anything but unfailing, and using it on a regular basis requires as much luck as recklessness. Persons who use such a talent aren't very popular among conservative spellcasters.\n"
"\n"
"Unlike the sorcerer, the spellshaper may learn spells from scrolls, and memorize and cast them like a wizard. Being opportunists at heart, rarely a spellshaper renounces this relative reliable way of working magic. It's usually reserved for those protective and last-resort spells that really need to work, though. The spellshaper's talent to cast spells spontaneously is so convenient that he prefers to use it whenever possible.\n"
"\n"
"Neglecting conventional spellcasting, and focussing on chaotic wild magic doesn't come without a price: A spellshaper can't memorize as many spells as a true mage, and his progress in getting access to new spell levels is much slower.\n"
"\n"
"Persons of this profession also tend to be a bit eccentric: Their undisciplined nature was what led them to their alternative way of spellcasting in the first place, and constant contact with chaotic wild magic affects the spellshaper's personality even more. Similar to a bard, a spellshaper has a lot of interests: He intuitively learns a bit of everything that crosses his path, but lacks the discipline to master these things to the same extend as a more focused character.\n"
"\n"
"Most spellshapers have the wisdom not to rely exclusively on their dangerous and unpredictable spell ability. They hedge their bets by learning physical combat as well. They aren't warriors, but a spellshaper's abilities in melee combat are close to those of a thief. As he gets more experienced, the spellshaper may learn special abilities that improve his combat techniques even more, these abilities include backstabbing, mastery in the dagger proficiency and the unique ability to fight with two weapons at once without facing any penalties.\n"
"\n"
"One of the spellshaper's more eccentric character-traits is that he refuses any training in the use of missile weapons; for ranged combat, a spellshaper uses magic, and if magic fails he prefers melee.\n"
"\n"
